AI orchestration for Laravel. Cortex manages **prompts (with immutable versioning), tools, and agents/sub-agents** on top of the [Laravel AI SDK](https://laravel.com/docs/ai-sdk), exposed through a REST API, a prebuilt dashboard, and an [MCP](https://laravel.com/docs/mcp) server mirroring the prompt/agent/tool operations.

- **Prompts** are versioned: content is immutable per version, and a published pointer decides what agents use. Roll back by publishing an older version.
- **Tools** are PHP classes implementing `Laravel\Ai\Contracts\Tool` or extending `Laravel\Mcp\Server\Tool` (wrapped automatically), registered by name in the Cortex tool registry. Their descriptions can be overridden at runtime with versioned, publishable content.
- **MCP servers** registered with Cortex get the same treatment for their instructions: versioned, publishable overrides that replace the code-declared instructions served to MCP clients, manageable over HTTP, MCP, and the dashboard.
- **Agents** are database records that combine a prompt (published or pinned version), registered tools, provider/model settings, and other agents as sub-agents. Run them via the API, the dashboard, the MCP server, or the `Cortex` facade.

## Installation

```bash
composer require jayi/cortex
```

Publish and run the migrations:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag="cortex-migrations"
php artisan migrate
```

Publish the config file to customize routes, the dashboard, MCP transports, and tools:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag="cortex-config"
```

The dashboard renders through Atrium, so publish its assets too:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag="atrium-assets"
```

## Configuration

```php
return [
    'routes' => [
        'prefix' => 'cortex',
        'middleware' => ['api'],
    ],
    'ui' => [
        'enabled' => true, // register Cortex with the Atrium dashboard
    ],
    'mcp' => [
        'web' => ['enabled' => false, 'route' => 'mcp/cortex', 'middleware' => []],
        'local' => ['enabled' => false, 'handle' => 'cortex'],
        'servers' => [
            // 'support' => \App\Mcp\SupportServer::class,
        ],
    ],
    'cache' => [
        'enabled' => true,
        'store' => null,
        'fresh' => 300,
        'stale' => 86400,
    ],
    'providers' => [
        // 'anthropic' => ['claude-sonnet-5', 'claude-opus-4-8'],
    ],
    'tools' => [
        // 'search' => \App\Ai\Tools\SearchTool::class,
        // \App\Mcp\Tools\LookupTool::class,
    ],
    'policies' => [
        // Agent::class => AgentPolicy::class, ... one entry per Cortex model
    ],
];
```

> [!WARNING]
> The API routes, dashboard, and MCP server manage **and execute** agents. The MCP transports are disabled by default and the API carries only the `api` middleware group. Before exposing them in production, add authentication — e.g. `'middleware' => ['api', 'auth:sanctum']` for the routes and `'middleware' => ['auth:sanctum']` for the MCP web transport. The dashboard is guarded by Atrium's `viewAtrium` gate; define it as shown under [Dashboard](#dashboard).

## Authorization

Every API endpoint and MCP tool that touches a model checks it through the Gate, using the policies in `cortex.policies`. It checks as the signed-in user, or as a guest when nobody is signed in. Listing or creating checks `viewAny` or `create` against the model class. Reading, changing, deleting, publishing or running checks `view`, `update`, `delete`, `publish` or `run` against the record.

Cortex records have no owner, so the bundled policies allow everything and your middleware stays the gate, as before. Version policies defer to their prompt or override through the Gate: reading a version needs `view` on it, adding or publishing one needs `update`. Point a model at your own policy class in `cortex.policies` to restrict it.

**Full guide:** [Policies](docs/policies.md). It covers what each endpoint and MCP tool checks, and how to replace a policy.

## Dashboard

Cortex renders its dashboard through [Atrium](https://github.com/jayi/atrium), which it requires. Install Atrium's gate and Cortex appears in the sidebar automatically:

```php
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Gate;

Gate::define('viewAtrium', fn ($user) => $user->is_admin);
```

The dashboard covers prompts and their versions, agents, a run playground, the tool registry with a versioned description editor, and the MCP server registry with a versioned instructions editor.

Atrium owns the path, the middleware and the authorization gate, so there is nothing to configure here beyond the single switch:

```php
// config/cortex.php
'ui' => ['enabled' => true],
```

Setting it to `false` removes Cortex from the dashboard and leaves the JSON API serving.

> **Authentication.** The pages are server-rendered under Atrium's path (`/atrium/cortex/...` by default) behind its `web` middleware and `viewAtrium` gate, so they authenticate the way the rest of your application does. Without a `viewAtrium` gate, Atrium allows only the `local` environment.

## Registering Tools

Tools implement `Laravel\Ai\Contracts\Tool` or extend `Laravel\Mcp\Server\Tool` — MCP tools are wrapped for agent use automatically. Register them in `config/cortex.php` under `tools` (string keys set the registered name; unkeyed entries derive it from the tool itself), or at runtime:

```php
use JayI\Cortex\Facades\Cortex;

Cortex::tools()->register('search', \App\Ai\Tools\SearchTool::class);
```

### Tool Description Overrides

A tool's code-declared description can be overridden without a deploy: each tool has an optional, immutably versioned description with a published pointer — same model as prompts. Manage overrides from the dashboard or the API (`/cortex/tools/{tool}/description`). Extend `JayI\Cortex\Tools\Tool` (or use the `JayI\Cortex\Tools\Concerns\HasVersionedDescription` trait on an existing MCP tool) so the tool also serves its published override when used directly outside Cortex.

## Managing Prompts and Agents

Everything is available over the REST API (prefix `cortex` by default):

| Method | URI | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| GET/POST | `/cortex/prompts` | List / create prompts (create stores version 1, published by default) |
| GET/PATCH/DELETE | `/cortex/prompts/{slug}` | Show / update metadata / delete |
| GET/POST | `/cortex/prompts/{slug}/versions` | List / create immutable versions |
| GET | `/cortex/prompts/{slug}/versions/{version}` | Show a version |
| POST | `/cortex/prompts/{slug}/versions/{version}/publish` | Publish a version |
| GET/POST | `/cortex/agents` | List / create agents |
| GET/PATCH/DELETE | `/cortex/agents/{slug}` | Show / update / delete |
| POST | `/cortex/agents/{slug}/run` | Run an agent with `{"input": "..."}` — returns `{text, usage}` |
| GET | `/cortex/providers` | List providers with their models and default model |
| GET | `/cortex/tools` | List registered tools with their schemas |
| GET/DELETE | `/cortex/tools/{tool}/description` | Show / remove the description override |
| GET/POST | `/cortex/tools/{tool}/description/versions` | List / create immutable override versions |
| POST | `/cortex/tools/{tool}/description/versions/{version}/publish` | Publish an override version |
| GET | `/cortex/servers` | List registered MCP servers with their effective instructions |
| GET/DELETE | `/cortex/servers/{server}/instructions` | Show / remove the instruction override |
| GET/POST | `/cortex/servers/{server}/instructions/versions` | List / create immutable override versions |
| POST | `/cortex/servers/{server}/instructions/versions/{version}/publish` | Publish an override version |

Agent create/update payloads accept `tools` (registered tool names), `prompt` (prompt slug), `prompt_version` (pin a version; omit to follow the published version), and `sub_agents` (agent slugs). The `tools` and `sub_agents` lists use sync semantics — send the desired end state. Circular sub-agent references are rejected.

```json
{
    "name": "Coordinator",
    "slug": "coordinator",
    "provider": "anthropic",
    "model": "claude-sonnet-5",
    "settings": {"temperature": 0.3, "max_steps": 10},
    "tools": ["search"],
    "prompt": "support",
    "sub_agents": ["researcher"]
}
```

## Running Agents from Code

```php
use JayI\Cortex\Facades\Cortex;

$response = Cortex::run('coordinator', 'Summarize the open tickets.');

$response->text;

// Or build the laravel/ai agent yourself:
Cortex::agent('coordinator')->stream('...');
```

Providers, models, and settings fall back to your app's `config/ai.php` defaults when not set on the agent.

## Providers

The dashboard's agent form and `GET /cortex/providers` offer the same provider and model list. By default every text-capable provider configured for laravel/ai is offered, along with the models it declares (default, smartest, cheapest). Set `cortex.providers` to curate the list — it becomes authoritative when non-empty, with the first model of each provider used as its default:

```php
'providers' => [
    'anthropic' => ['claude-sonnet-5', 'claude-opus-4-8'],
],
```

## Publication Cache

Published prompt content, tool description overrides, and MCP server instruction overrides are cached so agent runs, tool listings, and MCP handshakes don't hit the database on every request; publishing invalidates explicitly. When Redis is available it is preferred and read via `Cache::flexible()` using the `cache.fresh`/`cache.stale` windows (stale-while-revalidate); any other store caches until invalidation. Pin a store with `cache.store`, or set `cache.enabled` to `false` to read from the database on every pull.

## MCP Server

The `CortexServer` exposes the prompt, agent, tool, and server-instruction operations as MCP tools (22 tools: prompt CRUD + versions + publish, agent CRUD, list tools, run agent, server instructions + versions + publish). The provider and tool-description endpoints are HTTP-only. Enable a transport in the config:

```php
'mcp' => [
    'web' => ['enabled' => true, 'route' => 'mcp/cortex', 'middleware' => ['auth:sanctum']],
    'local' => ['enabled' => true, 'handle' => 'cortex'],
],
```

The web transport serves streamable HTTP at `/mcp/cortex`; the local transport is started with `php artisan mcp:start cortex` and inspectable with `php artisan mcp:inspector cortex`. Alternatively, keep both disabled and register the server yourself in `routes/ai.php`:

```php
use JayI\Cortex\Mcp\CortexServer;
use Laravel\Mcp\Facades\Mcp;

Mcp::web('/mcp/cortex', CortexServer::class)->middleware(['auth:sanctum']);
```

### Server Instruction Overrides

An MCP server's code-declared instructions (the `#[Instructions]` attribute or `$instructions` property) can be overridden without a deploy: each registered server has an optional, immutably versioned instruction override with a published pointer — same model as prompts and tool descriptions. Manage overrides from the dashboard, the API (`/cortex/servers/{server}/instructions`), or the MCP tools.

Cortex's own server is always registered as `cortex`. Register additional servers in `config/cortex.php` under `mcp.servers` (string keys set the registered name; unkeyed entries derive it from the server's `#[Name]` attribute or class basename), or at runtime:

```php
use JayI\Cortex\Facades\Cortex;

Cortex::servers()->register('support', \App\Mcp\SupportServer::class);
```

For the published override to actually be served to MCP clients, the server class must extend `JayI\Cortex\Mcp\Server` (or use the `JayI\Cortex\Mcp\Concerns\HasVersionedInstructions` trait if it cannot change its base class). Unregistered servers, and servers with no published version, keep serving their code-declared instructions.

## Events

- **Model events:** every Eloquent hook of every Cortex model fires its own class, such as `PromptCreatingEvent`, `AgentDeletedEvent` or `PromptVersionSavedEvent`.
- **Action events:** every action fires a start and a finish event, such as `PromptVersionPublishingActionEvent` and `PromptVersionPublishedActionEvent`, or `AgentRunningActionEvent` and `AgentRanActionEvent`. The start event fires before the work. The finish event fires after the transaction commits, and only on success.
- **Listening to a whole family:** listen to `ModelLifecycleEvent`, `ActionStartingEvent` or `ActionFinishedEvent` (in `JayI\Cortex\Contracts`) to receive every event of that family.

**Full guide:** [Events](docs/events.md). It lists every action with its two events and what they carry.

## Testing Your Integration

Fake agent responses with the Laravel AI SDK's testing helpers — Cortex agents all run through `JayI\Cortex\Runtime\DbAgent`:

```php
use JayI\Cortex\Runtime\DbAgent;

DbAgent::fake(['Canned response.']);

DbAgent::assertPrompted(fn ($prompt) => str_contains($prompt->prompt, 'tickets'));
```
